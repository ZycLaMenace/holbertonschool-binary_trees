Binary trees - A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, known as the left child and the right child. It is used for various applications including expression parsing and data organization.

## Description

This was a partner project in which we learned about the details, advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. We learned about how to
qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, we
implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [binary_trees.h](./binary_trees.h): Header file containing definitions and
prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. New node**

  * [11-binary_tree_size.c](./11-binary_tree_size.c): C function that returns
  the size of a binary tree.

* **12. Leaves**
  * [12-binary_tree_leaves.c](./12-binary_tree_leaves.c): C function that returns
  the number of leaves in a binary tree.

  the number of nodes in a binary tree with at least one child.

* **14. Balance factor**
  * [14-binary_tree_balance.c](./14-binary_tree_balance.c): C function that
  returns the balance factor of a binary tree.

* **15. Is full**
  * [15-binary_tree_is_full.c](./15-binary_tree_is_full.c): C function that
  checks if a binary tree is full.
  * Returns `1` if a tree is full, `0` otherwise.

* **16. Is perfect**
  * [16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c](./16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c): C function
  that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
  * Returns `1` if a tree is perfect, `0` otherwise.

* **17. Sibling**
  * [17-binary_tree_sibling.c](./17-binary_tree_sibling.c): C function that
  returns a pointer to the sibling of a given node in a binary tree.
  * Returns `NULL` if no sibling is found.

* **18. Uncle**
  * [18-binary_tree_uncle.c](./18-binary_tree_uncle.c): C function that
  returns a pointer to the uncle of a given node in a binary tree.
  * Returns `NULL` if no uncle is found.
